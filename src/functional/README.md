# Functional Programming for JavaScript (from Underscore)

The implementations of these functions are based on the implementations from
[`underscore`](https://underscorejs.org/) version 1.13.2.  In some cases, the
implementation was simplified to either remove cases not used in this
library or reduce the complexity of incorporating the code into this library.
