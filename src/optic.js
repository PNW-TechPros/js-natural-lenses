   * by this optic is not present in *options.on* or does not host a method
   * named *methodName*, the trivial function (`function () {}` or equivalent)
   * will be returned.
   *
   * By default, the binding is lazy — the target of the lens within *on* is
   * evaluated when the resulting Function is invoked (though *on* itself is
   * bound in this call).  To bind the resulting Function to its target
   * immediately when this method is called, set *options.bindNow* to `true`.
   *
   * @example
   * const data = {question: "What is the ultimate answer?"};
   * const qStarts = lens('question').binding('startsWith', {on: data});
   * qStarts('What') // => true
   * data.question = "Why is a raven like a writing desk?";
   * qStarts('What') // => false
   * qStarts('Why') // => true
   *
   * @example
   * const data = {question: "What is the ultimate answer?"};
   * const qStarts = lens('question').binding('startsWith', {on: data, bindNow: true});
   * qStarts('What') // => true
   * data.question = "Why is a raven like a writing desk?";
   * qStarts('What') // => true (because qStarts bound to the target of the lens when `binding` was called)
