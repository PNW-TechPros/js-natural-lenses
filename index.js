 * ## Asynchronicity without [asyncLogging]{@link module:natural-lenses#asyncLogging}
 *
 * If *body* registers callbacks that complete after it returns, logging calls
 * will return to targeting the *status quo ante* logger (or whatever logger
 * happens to be current at the time).  There is no way for this library to
 * detect this has happend and warn about pending callbacks logging to a
 * different logger.
 * 
 * If *body* returns a *thenable* (i.e. an object with a `then` property, like
 * a Promise), *logger* will remain the target logger until the result fulfills
 * or rejects.  A warning will also be logged because the target logger for
 * the entire process is changed by this usage.
 *
 * ## Asynchronicity with [asyncLogging]{@link module:natural-lenses#asyncLogging}
 *
 * If [asyncLogging]{@link module:natural-lenses#asyncLogging} has been called
 * to install an asynchronous-context-aware engine, then *logger* will be the
 * target logger during the execution of *body* and *for any asynchronous
 * execution starting within body*, whether via callback or thenable.

   * pairs (where the key is an integer index in the case of an Array multifocal).

   *
   * @description
   * Logging configuration is usually a global activity.  However, there are
   * cases where some specific section of the code needs to redirect its
   * logging to a different handler.
   *
   * In many languages and environments, this diversion of logging events would
   * be handled with a thread- or fiber-local variable.  JavaScript — with its
   * extensive use of closures and asynchronous callbacks/Promises — needs to
   * associate the logging diversion with the asynchronous context of the
   * code setting the logger.  There is, however, no standard way to do this.
   *
   * To bridge this gap, [natural-lenses]{@link module:natural-lenses} provides
   * *asynchronous context engines* which can be configured on demand.  Setting
   * the engine does not change the current logger, but can allow code to
   * change the logger in a more local fashion.  Configuring the appropriate
   * asynchronous context engine makes [setLogger.forBlock]{@link module:natural-lenses~BlockLogger}
   * much more adept at getting logging events to the correct handler in
   * asynchronous contexts.

/**

 *
 * @description
 * The intent of the method is to clone the container with some kind of
 * alteration -- either a key/index set to the given value in the clone, or a
 * key/index deleted from the clone.
 *
 * If the operation description passed contains a `set` property,
 * the value of that property should be an Array where element 0 is a key or
 * index into the container and element 1 is the value to set (cf. arguments
 * to `Map.prototype.set`).
 *
 * If the operation description passed contains a `spliceOut` property,
 * the value of that property should be a key or index to delete from the
 * container.  Where possible, the result should be to leave the container
 * in a state where `container[at_maybe](key)` returns `{}` (a *Nothing*).
 * This is specifically a problem for [immutable.List]{@link external:immutable.List},
 * which offers only a dense presentation of elements: every non-negative index
 * less than `size` is a valid and "contained" entry.  The implementation provided
 * by this library for implementing this method on
 * [immutable.List]{@link external:immutable.List} sets the value of the entry
 * in the clone to `undefined`.
 *
 * In the provided implemenation for Array, negative indexes are interpreted
 * counting backward from the end of the Array, as with `Array.prototype.slice`.
 *
 * `Symbol.species` is honored for determining the constructor used for the
 * clone; Object is a special case that defaults to Object if `Symbol.species`
 * is not present.
 *
 * In a future major version, it is likely that the call interface for this
 * method will change to `function({key: *} | {key: *, just: *}): *`, where
 * presence of `just` (and its associated value) in the argument represents a
 * "setting" of *key* in the result, and absence of `just` represents omission
 * of *key* from the result.
